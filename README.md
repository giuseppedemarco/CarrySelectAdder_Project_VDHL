Carry Select Adder - Digital Electronics Project

This repository contains the project developed for the Digital Electronics exam at the University of Calabria. The project focuses on the design, implementation, and simulation of a Carry Select Adder (CSA) in VHDL, a high-speed digital circuit used for binary addition. The CSA is designed to improve calculation speed by dividing the addition process into smaller, parallelizable segments, allowing faster computation compared to traditional adders like the Ripple Carry Adder.

The main components of the project include:

- VHDL Design: Code for the implementation of the Carry Select Adder using VHDL.
- Simulation Files: Testbenches and simulation scripts for functional verification.
- Synthesis Reports: Data on area, power, and speed characteristics after synthesis.
- 
This project aims to provide a clear example of digital design techniques and efficient adder architectures, suitable for educational purposes and further research.
